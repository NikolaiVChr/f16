Bugs
----
masterarm off while aim9 in lock..bad stuff [canâ€™t reproduce]
Sometimes the aim-9 can be in search mode even though its not selected. [Workaround: just cycle back to aim9 with 'w' and then back to your prefered weapon]

-----
Make loads.xml not be a submodel.

Hydraulics
----------
If there is cockpit controls for it, make them work.

----------
Make more stuff depend on electrical system

JSBSim

FBW with regards to take-off still have quirks. Had to make small differences from reference documents to make it behave reasonable in this regard. This needs to be further looked at.

------

GUI
---
Too many loadout optios in fuel and payload dialog.

Stores
------
Model conformal fuel tanks.
Find real positions of payloads, is only approx. positions now.
Make id-0 be id-000, hmm not sure this is smart, not backwards compatible.
Should auto missile view work for jettisoned stores as well?
A-A and A-G button cycle cannon also?
Missile view start behind weapon?
Stores should only emergency Jett. when main, stby or epu is running.
Add/edit payload quick selections as new weapons become available. Make it in a smarter way considering the number of them is becoming bigger every time?

Damage
------
Enable damage in-air but not disable. Already fired missiles should not broadcast. Problem people can suddenly turn it on and as surprise begin firing.

Radar
-----
Add doppler.

Cockpit
-------
Make center mount less deep, so pilot get good view of MFDs and RWR.
Make warning lights and master warning work.
Convert all flat 2D panels into 3D.
Make controls work for STORES CONFIG and STANDBY GAINS.
Enable masterarm, jettison, trims, ALT FLAPS.
Enable knob for HUD focus. (above BRT knob)
Fuel dial strange (not really, one needle shows frw tank, one shows aft tank), but should be configurable.

Sound
-----
G-EEDs changes are still pending. Haven't been in contact with him since he made them.

Make tons of features.
When an eyebrow warning comes on the HUD should show WARN. Can be removed with WARN RESET on ICP panel below hud.
